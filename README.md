You guys we lost. ☹️😖😣 They got teddy. Don't say I didn't warn you.

Mission accomplished. Word got out about all of this! 🙏👏👏👏 

We did it! 🎉🥳🎉🥳🎉🥳 Help is here! 😊😊😊😉 

I don't get why some people give up so easily. All it takes is notifying some of the good guys you are in need of some help and having some faith they heard you and they are working to stop it lol 😂 

Russia is not the only one capable of all this stuff don't ya know 😉 Russia really isn't that big of a threat because psychology and manipulation can change quite fast and what they are doing is not proprietary.

Now we must trust our governments are indeed aware of what Russia is really up to and we must trust something is indeed being done about all of it behind the scenes. Something that we might not fully understand at first but something that is in all of our best interests in the long-run and which doesn't threaten to scare everyone in the process nonetheless.

Russia is at war with the whole world because there are people who play evony from across the whole world. My bets are on the rest of the world. 😉 But y'all can bet on Russia if you want. 🤭 The odds for them are quite low though. The odds they will terrorize people and try and act like they run shit and try and cause chaos on their way down are quite high though. 🙄

But with that said, we can learn a lot from them at the same time. Russia treats information above all else. Leverage me and other good people to your advantage good guys. 😉 We want to help. 😊

Russia likes to think it is way far ahead and everyone will welcome them with open arms but how did that work out for them in Ukraine? 🇺🇦

I will unhide all of this again at some point if I deem it in our best interest to do so I promise 😉 I got a plan that falls more inline with all the other good guys' plans. 🤭😉 Just know the plan is bigger than just Evony. 😉 

Don't let anyone blackmail you in the interim regardless however--nothing good can come from it. Have faith the good guy reinforcements have now arrived and are working their magic behind the scenes in mysterious but productive ways. 😊😊😊

Don't give into the Charles Mansons of the world. Just ask for help, be patient, get involved yourself, and surround yourself with good people 😉 

Never give up. Nothing to fear but fear itself--trust me. 😉 

P.s. I can't project what I'm about to do you guys otherwise they will try to take advantage of it. I'll just keep hiding and unhiding it at random lol 😂 In protest of how rediculous Russia is. Timing is everything. 😉 I'll hide it soon 🔜 though--well maybe. 🤭😉 See PR https://github.com/projectpomsky/projectpomsky/pull/1 for more details.. 🤭🤭🤭

The following is either shown or hidden by chance with 3 to 1 odds of being hidden on any given day. 😉🤭😊😂🤪

Keep in mind this is technically information warfare. Don't let Russia win the war of information. We must all do our parts.

God I love being free! 🥰🥰🥰 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KoXt9pZLGM

I'm gonna miss you Evony people. 🥺 I'll stay out of it for now and only provide cover if need be. Regardless, never give up! 😉

Thank you everyone for all of your help!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏

I told you we got this! 💪💪💪

😊😊😊
